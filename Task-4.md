# **Function in C program**
## Welcome my dear teamates,
<!-- Italics -->
## *TODAY IM GOING TO SHOW THE BRAIN POINTS OF C PROGRAM*
- A function is a group of statements that perform together a task
- Every C program has at least one function.
- That is main () and all are more trival programs.
- A function declaration tells the compiler about  a function name ,return type and parameters.

## **Defining Function**
<!-- Horizontal Rule -->
____
____
<!-- Blockquote -->
 > A Function definition is a C programming consists of a function header 
and function body
<!-- Strong -->
### **These are four types**
 - **RETURN TYPE**
    -
    - A function may return a value . The return type is the data type of the value the      function returns.
     - Some of functions perform the desired operations without returing a value 
    - This case ,the return_type is the keyword <!-- strong --> **void**
- **FUNCTION NAME**
    -
     - This is the actual name of the function .    
     - The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
- **PARAMETERS**     
    -
    
     - A parameters is like a placeholder.when a function is invoked ,you pass a value to the parameter.
     - This is the value is referred to as actual parameter or argument.
     - The parameters list refer to the type, order, and number of the function .
- **FUNCTION BODY**
    -
    - The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
    - A function is a group of statements that together to perform a task.
 ## EXAMPLE
<!-- Strong -->   
  - **This function takes two maters num1 and num2 and return the maximun value between the two functions**

**FUNCTION DECLARATIONS**
-
___
*A Function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function.The actual body of the function can be defined seperately*
-
              return_type function_name(parameter list );
*For above function max(), the function declaration is*
-
                    int max(int num1,int num2);            
*Parameters name are not more important in function devclaration only their type is requried*
-
                          int max(int,int);

**CALLING FUNCTION**   
-         
___
  
- **While creating a C function,you give a definition of what the function has to do.**
- **To use a function,you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.**
- **When a program calls the function,the program control is transferred to  the called function**
- **A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function ending closing brace is reached**
- **It return the program control back to the main program.**
- **To call a function ,you simply needd to pass the required parameters**
- **Along the function name and its function returns a value**
- **Then you can store the returned value**
- **If a function is use arguments,it must declare a variable that accept the values**
- **These varaibles are called formal parmeters of the function**
